1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

parentNode.appendChild(childNode)

existingNode.cloneNode(true | false)

The first method is used to attach the nodes to the DOM tree, and the second is to clone the latest node. The second method also allows you to choose whether or not the cloned node should include any child nodes of the existing node.
